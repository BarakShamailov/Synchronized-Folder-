# Synchronized Folder

This project is a Synchronized Folder implemented by a server, similar to Google Drive and Dropbox.

It is actually a desktop application.The project is written in Python, the network is implemented using sockets, and the client side is implemented using Tkinter. 

The main goal of the app is to upload files and share files with multiple users in real time.

The app's capabilities are:
* Uploading files and folders that includes files to the server.
* Creating new folders.
* Downloading files from the server.
* Renaming files or folder.
* Deleting files or folders.
* Navigating between subfolders and parent folders.
* Moving folders and files from one folder to another.

## Installation instructions:
1. First, create a new project in the IDE (the IDE I worked with is PyCharm). Then, copy the contents of the src folder from the ZIP to the new project opened in the IDE.
2. Now, install an external library named PIL using the terminal with the command -
pip install pillow.
3. After installing the library, you can run the server.py file that runs the server.
And then also the client.py application.
